# Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression

## Business Problem Overview

In the telecom industry, customers have the flexibility to choose from multiple service providers and often switch between them. With an average annual churn rate of 15-25%, the telecommunications industry faces the challenge of retaining customers in this highly competitive market. Acquiring new customers is significantly more costly than retaining existing ones, making customer retention a top priority.

For many incumbent operators, retaining highly profitable customers is the primary business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. This project analyzes customer-level data from a leading telecom firm, builds predictive models to identify high-risk churn customers, and identifies the main indicators of churn.

### What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers discontinue their business relationship with a company or service. In the telecom industry, customers have the freedom to choose from various service providers and frequently switch between them. The annual churn rate in this competitive market is significant, making it imperative to address this issue. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

To detect early signs of potential churn, it is essential to develop a holistic view of customers and their interactions across multiple channels. Addressing churn not only helps companies maintain their market position but also promotes growth. Reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategies are key factors for success.

## Objectives

- Determine the percentage of churned customers and those who continue to use active services.
- Analyze the dataset to identify factors responsible for customer churn.
- Select the most suitable machine learning model for accurate classification of churn and non-churn customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is "WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv."

## Tool

This project is implemented using Google Colab.
